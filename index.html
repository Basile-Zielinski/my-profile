    <h3>Reading Books</h3>
     <p>
      I'm interested in ancient civilizations and mythology (mostly greek and roman) it amazes me. I also like books on strategy (The book of five Rings, The Prince, The art of War) because it teaches you things you can apply on a daily basis.

    <h3>Learning new languages and discovering new cultures 🗺</h3>
     <p>
      When I was younger I had the opportunity to travel frequently and to live abroad. It made me realize how important it is to be able to communicate with others. It was clear that in order to communicate, the best way to do so is to learn the language of your conversation partner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Discovering a new culture may be the best thing when travelling ✈️. You get to learn the traditions, the gastronomy and the lifestyle of the community. It's super cool and interesting in my opinion.
